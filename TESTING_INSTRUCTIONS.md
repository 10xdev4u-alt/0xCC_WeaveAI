### Tour Stop 1: The Human-Like Conversation

Let's start by testing WEAVE's core cognitive and linguistic abilities.

**1. Experience True Multilingualism:**
*   In the chat box, type: **"Bhai kuch kurta dikhao shaadi ke liye"**
*   **What to Observe:**
    *   **Instant Recognition:** Notice how WEAVE responds instantly and naturally in Hinglish, without missing a beat.
    *   **Real-time Memory:** Look at the **Thread Memory™** panel on the right. See how it immediately identifies the `language` and `intent` ("Wedding Apparel"). This is Gemini 2.0 Flash providing sub-500ms cognition.

**2. Test Its Deeper Understanding:**
*   Now, follow up with: **"something more traditional"**
*   **What to Observe:**
    *   **Contextual Awareness:** WEAVE doesn't ask "traditional what?". It *knows* you're still talking about kurtas for a wedding. It will refine its recommendations based on this new context. This demonstrates the power of our short-term memory layer.

### Tour Stop 2: The Style DNA™ Engine

Now, let's witness how WEAVE learns and predicts your unique taste.

*   **Click the "🎊 Wedding Shopping" scenario button.**
*   **What to Observe:**
    *   **Automated Flow:** Watch as an automated conversation unfolds, designed to quickly build a style profile.
    *   **The "Style Fingerprint":** As the demo runs, observe the **Style DNA™** section in the Memory Panel. You'll see it populate with attributes like `Color Palette`, `Fabric Preference`, and `Formality Level`. This is Gemini 2.0 Pro's deep reasoning at work.
    *   **Hyper-Personalized Sizing:** Notice the product recommendations include a specific, personalized size (e.g., "Recommended Size: M (Slim Fit)"). This is the output of the Style DNA agent, designed to slash return rates.

### Tour Stop 3: The Omnichannel Bridge

Here, we'll demonstrate how WEAVE dissolves the barrier between online and in-store shopping.

*   **Scroll to "The Bridge" section and click "▶ Run Bridge Demo".**
*   **What to Observe:**
    *   **Seamless Sync:** A simulated WhatsApp conversation appears on the left, while a "Store Associate Tablet" appears on the right. Watch as the customer's chat history, product interest, and Style DNA™ are **instantly** synced to the tablet.
    *   **Empowering the Associate:** The store associate doesn't have to ask "How can I help you?". They can greet the customer with, "Hi PrinceTheProgrammer, I see you were looking at the blue silk kurta. I have it right here for you." This is the end of channel amnesia.

### Tour Stop 4: The Guardian Agent (Cart Rescue)

See how WEAVE proactively recovers potentially lost revenue.

*   **Click the "🚨 Cart Rescue" scenario button.**
*   **What to Observe:**
    *   **Intelligent Intervention:** The demo will simulate a user abandoning their cart. WEAVE's Guardian Agent doesn't just send a generic "You left something!" message.
    *   **Contextual Offer:** The agent intelligently intervenes with a personalized offer, perhaps noting that stock is low to create urgency. This is proactive, not reactive, engagement.

### Key Features to Keep an Eye On:

*   **✅ The Thread Memory™ Panel:** This is the "mind's eye" of WEAVE. Watch it update with every interaction. It's a real-time log of the AI's understanding.
*   **✅ Multimodal Input:** Try the **"📷 Image Matching"** scenario to see how WEAVE can "see" and understand images to find similar products.
*   **✅ Fully Responsive Design:** Feel free to test this entire experience on your mobile device.
