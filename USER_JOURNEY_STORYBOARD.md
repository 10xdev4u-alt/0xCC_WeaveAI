## User: Anya Sharma, 28, Fashion Enthusiast in Hyderabad
**Goal:** Find a unique outfit for a friend's upcoming sangeet, and possibly a gift.

### **Phase 1: Initial Discovery & Style Profiling (Web & Voice)**

**1. Scenario:** Anya is casually browsing fashion blogs on her tablet. She sees an outfit she likes but can't find it anywhere.

*   **Touchpoint:** Web App (Mobile Tablet)
*   **Action:** Anya opens the WEAVE app (or a WEAVE-integrated partner site) and clicks the "Image Match" feature. She uploads a screenshot of the outfit.
*   **WEAVE in Action:**
    *   **Discovery Agent (The Seeker):** Uses Gemini's multimodal vision capabilities to analyze the image, identifying style elements (e.g., "embroidered lehenga," "floral pattern," "contemporary silhouette").
    *   **Style DNA Agent (The Stylist):** Begins to build Anya's preliminary Style DNA profile based on this visual input.
    *   **Thread Memory™:** Stores the image query and initial Style DNA vectors.
*   **Output:** WEAVE returns several similar lehengas, noting brands and price points. Anya likes a few, adds them to a wishlist.

### **Phase 2: Deepening Engagement & Preference Capture (WhatsApp)**

**2. Scenario:** A few days later, Anya is on WhatsApp, chatting with her friend about the sangeet. She remembers the lehengas.

*   **Touchpoint:** WhatsApp
*   **Action:** Anya opens her WhatsApp chat with WEAVE and types (or voice notes in Hinglish): "Hey, I was looking for a lehenga for a sangeet a few days ago, like the blue one I saw."
*   **WEAVE in Action:**
    *   **Voice Agent (The Linguist):** If a voice note, transcribes the Hinglish with high accuracy.
    *   **Gemini Orchestration Layer:** Recognizes Anya, understands the Hinglish, detects intent (`continue_shopping`, `reference_past_item`), and routes to the Discovery Agent.
    *   **Thread Memory™:** The Discovery Agent pulls Anya's full context using the 2M token window, retrieving her previous web search, wishlist, and partial Style DNA. It identifies the exact "blue one" she's referring to.
*   **Output:** WEAVE sends images of the exact blue lehenga, along with "You might also like these, based on your emerging Style DNA" (showing 2-3 similar, but fresh recommendations). WEAVE also suggests, "We noticed your friend's sangeet is coming up. Would you like to explore gifts for them?"

### **Phase 3: Collaborative & Contextual Shopping (Web & Family Sync)**

**3. Scenario:** Anya loves the suggestion. She wants to show her sister, Riya, for a second opinion and to help pick a gift.

*   **Touchpoint:** Web App
*   **Action:** Anya clicks a "Share with Family" button on the WEAVE web interface. She invites Riya via WhatsApp. Riya accepts.
*   **WEAVE in Action:**
    *   **Family Sync Agent (The Elder):** Creates a shared shopping session. Riya's interactions and preferences during this session contribute to a shared context for the lehenga decision and the gift selection. If Riya has her own WEAVE profile, her Style DNA might influence the gift recommendations.
    *   **Thread Memory™:** The shared session and any new inputs from Riya are stored, enriching the context for both users.
*   **Output:** Anya and Riya browse and discuss options in a collaborative interface. WEAVE provides gift suggestions tailored to the friend's (and possibly Riya's) Style DNA, ensuring a thoughtful choice. They narrow down the lehenga choice and select a scarf as a gift.

### **Phase 4: Digital to Physical Bridge & Proactive Engagement (Store Kiosk & WhatsApp)**

**4. Scenario:** Anya wants to try on the lehenga before buying. She lives near a partner store.

*   **Touchpoint:** Web App / Store Kiosk
*   **Action:** Anya uses the WEAVE app to find the nearest store that has her chosen lehenga in stock and books an appointment to try it on. She selects "in-store pickup" for the gift scarf.
*   **WEAVE in Action:**
    *   **Bridge Agent (The Courier):** Seamlessly transfers Anya's entire digital context (chosen lehenga, Style DNA, gift details, appointment time) to the store's WEAVE-powered POS system and a store associate's tablet.
    *   **Proactive Agent (The Herald):** Sets up a reminder for Anya's appointment.
    *   **Thread Memory™:** Updates with appointment details and changes in inventory.
*   **Output:** Anya receives an appointment confirmation on WhatsApp. When she arrives, the store associate, fully briefed, greets her by name, presents the lehenga in her size, and has the gift scarf ready.

### **Phase 5: Post-Purchase & Continued Relationship (WhatsApp)**

**5. Scenario:** Anya loved her experience. A few weeks later, she receives a message.

*   **Touchpoint:** WhatsApp
*   **Action:** Anya opens a message from WEAVE.
*   **WEAVE in Action:**
    *   **Proactive Agent (The Herald):** Leveraging Anya's Style DNA and purchase history (the lehenga), sends a personalized message: "Hi Anya! We noticed you recently bought a lehenga. Here are some complementary accessories (jewelry, clutch) that would perfectly match your style, just in time for the wedding season."
    *   **Thread Memory™:** Continuously analyzes post-purchase behavior and engagement with proactive messages.
*   **Output:** Anya is delighted. The suggestions are genuinely useful and align with her new purchase, fostering loyalty and driving future sales.

This complete journey illustrates how WEAVE transforms fragmented, transactional shopping into a continuous, intelligent, and deeply human relationship.
