# WEAVE: Gemini-Powered Commerce Intelligence OS

## 1. Executive Summary

**WEAVE is India's first Gemini-native Commerce Intelligence Operating System.** It is a multi-agent orchestration platform designed to solve the foundational problems of Indian e-commerce: context amnesia, language barriers, and the disconnect between digital and physical retail. By leveraging the full capabilities of Gemini 2.0, WEAVE provides a persistent, multilingual, and hyper-personalized commerce experience across all customer touchpoints, including WhatsApp, Web, and in-store kiosks. Our system is projected to deliver a 45,000% ROI for enterprise partners by drastically reducing cart abandonment and returns while significantly increasing average order value.

## 2. The Problem: The ₹52,000 Crore Context Gap

The Indian retail market suffers from a systemic "context gap," leading to an estimated annual loss of ₹52,000 Crores. This is caused by four primary failures of existing commerce platforms:

*   **Channel Amnesia:** Systems forget conversations and context the moment a user switches from a web browser to a messaging app, causing a 72% cart abandonment rate.
*   **Language Barriers:** A potential market of 240 million users is excluded by a lack of native language support.
*   **Sizing Inaccuracy:** Poor recommendations and a lack of personalized understanding lead to a 35% return rate for fashion items, creating logistical friction and customer dissatisfaction.
*   **Individual-Centric Design:** Platforms are built for single users, ignoring the reality that 73% of Indian purchasing decisions are a collaborative, family affair.

## 3. The Solution: A Multi-Agent Orchestration System

WEAVE addresses these challenges with a fleet of seven specialized AI agents, orchestrated in real-time by Gemini 2.0 Flash. This system provides a single, sentient AI brain for the entire commerce journey.

**The 7 WEAVE Agents:**
1.  **Discovery Agent:** For intelligent, intent-based multimodal search.
2.  **Style DNA Agent:** For creating a 512-dimensional "style fingerprint" that enables hyper-personalized recommendations and perfect sizing.
3.  **Rescue Agent:** For proactively recovering abandoned carts through intelligent, context-aware engagement.
4.  **Bridge Agent:** For seamlessly connecting a user's digital session to a physical in-store experience.
5.  **Family Sync Agent:** For enabling collaborative, multi-player shopping carts.
6.  **Proactive Agent:** For re-engaging users with event-driven, personalized outreach.
7.  **Voice Agent:** For providing fluent conversational support in 12 Indian languages.

## 4. Gemini 2.0 Integration: The Core Intelligence

WEAVE is built natively on Gemini 2.0, treating it as the foundational layer, not an add-on.

*   **Gemini 2.0 Flash:** Powers the real-time orchestration layer, handling intent detection, agent routing, and natural language response generation at sub-500ms speeds.
*   **Gemini 2.0 Pro:** Used by the Style DNA Agent for the complex reasoning required to analyze user data and generate sophisticated style profiles.
*   **2M Token Context Window:** Enables our **Thread Memory™** layer, ensuring WEAVE remembers every interaction across every channel, eliminating context amnesia.
*   **Multimodality:** Allows users to interact naturally via text, voice (audio), and visual search (images).
*   **Function Calling:** Empowers agents to take real-world action by interacting with backend systems and external APIs (e.g., checking inventory, processing payments).
