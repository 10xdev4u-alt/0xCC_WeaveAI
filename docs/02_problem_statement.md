# 2. The Problem: The Context Amnesia Crisis

The foundational problem WEAVE is built to solve is **"Context Amnesia"** — the inability of modern commerce systems to remember, understand, and build upon previous interactions with a user. This creates a fragmented, impersonal, and frustrating customer journey, leading to massive revenue loss for retailers.

## The Disconnected Customer Journey (Today)

Consider a typical customer journey without WEAVE:

*   **Day 1: Instagram**
    *   A user sees a kurta they love on a brand's Instagram page. They "like" it. The brand's system registers a "like," but nothing more.

*   **Day 3: WhatsApp**
    *   The user initiates a chat with the brand's WhatsApp business number. They are greeted with a generic "Hi, how can I help you?". The system has **NO MEMORY** of the Instagram interaction.

*   **Day 5: Website**
    *   The user visits the brand's website. They are treated as a new user, possibly shown a pop-up for a first-time discount. The system has **NO MEMORY** of the Instagram "like" or the WhatsApp chat.

*   **Day 7: Physical Store**
    *   The user walks into a physical store. An associate asks, "What are you looking for today?". The system has **NO MEMORY** of any previous digital touchpoint.

This is the "Context Amnesia Crisis." The user has had four separate interactions, but has been treated as a stranger each time.

## The Financial Impact

This crisis is not just a matter of poor user experience; it has a staggering financial impact on the Indian retail market, estimated at **₹52,000 Crores lost annually**. This loss is driven by four key metrics:

| Metric | Problem | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **Cart Abandonment** | **72%** of shopping carts are abandoned. Users add items but leave due to distractions, price shock, or uncertainty, and retailers have no effective way to continue the conversation. | Direct, immediate loss of sales. |
| **Returns (Sizing)** | **35%** of fashion apparel is returned, primarily due to poor fit. This incurs massive reverse logistics costs and damages customer satisfaction. | High operational costs and erosion of profit margins. |
| **Language Barrier** | **240 Million** users in India are more comfortable shopping in their native language but are excluded by English-first platforms. | A huge, untapped market segment is completely ignored. |
| **Family Decisions** | **73%** of Indian purchasing decisions are influenced by family members, yet digital carts are designed for a single user, failing to accommodate this collaborative behavior. | Friction in the buying process leads to abandoned purchases. |
