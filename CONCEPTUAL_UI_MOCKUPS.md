# WEAVE: Conceptual UI Mockup Descriptions - Bringing Sentience to the Screen

While WEAVE's intelligence operates across multiple channels (WhatsApp, store kiosks), its most visually rich interactions occur within our Web App. This document provides textual descriptions of key UI elements, demonstrating how our Gemini-powered agents and Thread Memory™ manifest in a compelling and intuitive user experience.

## 1. The Core Chat Interface: "Converse" View

This is the primary user interaction point, designed for a seamless, AI-driven conversation.

*   **Layout:** Dominant central chat window, flanked by two side panels: "Thread Memory™" (right) and "Recommended Products" (left/bottom).
*   **Chat Input:** A smart input field that supports text, voice recording (microphone icon), and image upload (camera/gallery icon). The microphone icon pulses subtly when Gemini's Voice Agent is active or listening.
*   **Message Bubbles:** Standard chat bubbles. WEAVE's responses are clearly distinguishable (e.g., a subtle WEAVE logo next to the bubble, or a distinct color).
    *   **Interactive Responses:** WEAVE's messages often contain rich elements:
        *   Product cards (image, name, price, quick-add-to-cart).
        *   "Quick Action" buttons (e.g., "Show More Like This," "Try on In-Store," "Share with Friend").
        *   Contextual questions (e.g., "Are you shopping for a special occasion?").
*   **"Typing..." Indicator:** Displays "WEAVE is thinking..." when Gemini is processing, followed by "WEAVE is typing..." for a human-like delay before response.

## 2. The Thread Memory™ Panel: "The Mind's Eye" (Right Sidebar)

This dynamic, always-present sidebar is a visual representation of WEAVE's real-time understanding and memory, designed to foster transparency and trust.

*   **Collapsible/Expandable:** Users can minimize it to focus on the chat, but its presence is a constant reminder of WEAVE's intelligence.
*   **Sections (Real-time Updates):**
    *   **Current Intent:** Displays what WEAVE believes the user's current goal is (e.g., "Searching for Wedding Attire," "Recovering Abandoned Cart," "Building Style Profile").
    *   **Detected Context:** Key entities and attributes extracted by Gemini (e.g., `Occasion: Sangeet`, `Color Preference: Blue`, `Budget: Mid-range`).
    *   **Active Agents:** Shows which WEAVE agents are currently engaged (e.g., `Discovery Agent`, `Style DNA Agent`).
    *   **Memory Timeline (Scrollable):** A chronologically ordered, simplified log of key past interactions and system learnings. Each entry is a small card (e.g., `[2 days ago] Viewed Blue Lehenga (Web)`, `[1 week ago] Purchased Silk Scarf (WhatsApp)`, `[Current] Building Style DNA`). Clicking an entry reveals more detail.
    *   **Style DNA Snapshot:** A miniature, evolving visualization of the user's Style DNA (e.g., a circular graph showing preference for "Traditional," "Modern," "Casual," "Bohemian," or a tag cloud of dominant style attributes).

## 3. Style DNA™ Profile Page: "Your Aesthetic Blueprint"

A dedicated section accessible from the user's profile, providing a detailed breakdown of their personalized style.

*   **Visualizations:**
    *   **512-Dimensional Style Vector (Simplified):** A sophisticated, interactive radar chart or a multi-axis slider system representing key style dimensions (e.g., "Formal vs. Casual," "Minimalist vs. Maximalist," "Warm vs. Cool Tones," "Traditional vs. Contemporary"). Users can subtly adjust these.
    *   **Influencing Factors:** A list of items, brands, and designers that have most influenced the Style DNA, derived from Gemini's analysis.
    *   **"Why This Style?" Explainer:** A brief, human-readable summary generated by Gemini Pro explaining the user's dominant style characteristics based on their data.
*   **Control & Feedback:**
    *   "Adjust My Style DNA" button: Allows users to provide explicit feedback ("I prefer X over Y," "Don't show me Z brands") to further fine-tune recommendations.
    *   "Clear History for Style DNA" option: Allows users to reset parts of their style profile, respecting privacy and evolving tastes.

## 4. The Bridge View: "Seamless Omnichannel"

A specialized interface for our Bridge Agent, demonstrating the digital-to-physical handoff.

*   **Split Screen (Simulated):** On the left, a standard WEAVE chat interface or a simplified WhatsApp chat. On the right, a "Store Associate Tablet" view.
*   **Store Associate Tablet View:**
    *   **Customer Profile:** Displays the customer's name, booking time, and a summary of their recent WEAVE activity (e.g., "Looking for a blue lehenga, interested in trying size M").
    *   **Customer's Chat History:** A compact, scrollable view of the customer's recent conversation with WEAVE, providing the associate with full context.
    *   **Recommended Products for Associate:** Based on the customer's Style DNA and recent views, the system suggests 2-3 additional items the associate might show the customer during their visit.
    *   "Item Pick-up" / "Appointment Ready" Status: Visual indicators for the associate.
*   **"Sync to In-Store" Button:** Clearly shows the action that triggers the data transfer, emphasizing the seamless integration.

These conceptual mockups highlight WEAVE's commitment to a user experience that is not only intelligent but also transparent, controllable, and truly intuitive across all touchpoints.
